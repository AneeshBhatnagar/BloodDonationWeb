# Blood Donation System Web Application
#### Built by Aneesh Bhatnagar
The Blood Donation System was built as a part of my undergraduate degree. This project served as a web interface to the Android Application and also served as a REST API that the Android Application used to communicate with the server.
The design for the interface is a responsive design that adapts to the user's screen automatically and displays all the relevant information.
